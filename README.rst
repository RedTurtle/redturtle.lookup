Development
===========

There are two main parts:

- api
- app

Api
---

Api folder is the folder where there are some api endpoints called from the frontend view to manage sites and products.

App
---

App folder contains a React app bootstrapped with create-react-app.

The app is bult with sematic-ui framework.

To develop, you need to start a Plone site in background:
you can use the buildout in this package, or the instance that you want.

In package.json there is a proxy set for 8080 port, so if your instance runs on another port, you need to change that value.

The first time that you develop react app, you need to install its dependencies::

    yarn
 
Then you need to run the dev server::

    yarn start
   
To build a new version of the app::

    yarn build

The new build will be automatically seen in the Plone view.
